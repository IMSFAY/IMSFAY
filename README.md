# IMSFAY
Home of the Information Management System for Families, Adults, and Youth (IMSFAY).

IMSFAY is the successor to the 17-year old *Freemed-YiRC* (*Youth in Residential Care*) project.  Not to be confused with the excellent [Freemed](http://freemedsoftware.org/) software, of which Freemed-YiRC forked from in 1999 due to the two projects targetting very different audiences.

IMSFAY is a web-based information system for agencies (both non-profit and profit alike) who specialize in the care of children with behavioral health issues.  The focus of IMSFAY is the state of Ohio (*USA*), as all agencies who've made use of Freemed-YiRC have been Ohio-based and have been licensed and/or accredited by Ohio-based government agencies.

IMSFAY is currently in the development phase and will be going live at one agency at the start of 2018 for use with behavioral health progress notes and billing of those notes.  IMSFAY will eventually replicate and supercede the components of the older Freemed-YiRC system, including service plans, casenotes, and much, much, more.

There are two primary reasons for starting the IMSFAY project:

* Age and maintainability of the Freemed-YiRC software
* Major changes involved with the [State of Ohio Behavioral Health redesign](http://bh.medicaid.ohio.gov/manuals). 

IMSFAY will make use of the following software projects:
* [The Platform Framework](http://www.theplatformframework.com)
  * Operating system and project platform
  * This project makes heavy use of the following other projects:
    * [Qubes OS](http://www.qubes-os.com) - *A reasonably secure operating system*
    * [Keycloak](http://www.keycloak.org/) - *Open Source Identity and Access Management*
* [CIDME](https://github.com/JoeThielen/CIDME) - *Contextual IDentity Management Engine*
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - *Open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS.*
* Also: *Apache*, *PHP*, *MySQL*, *Neo4j*, and much, much more...

IMSFAY is primarily being developed by Joe Thielen ([GitHub](https://github.com//JoeThielen) / [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/joethielen)).  [Genacross Family & Youth Services](http://genacrosslutheranservices.org/services/family-and-youth/) (formerly *Lutheran Homes Society/LHS - Family & Youth Services*) is the primary funder of the development.
